                <h2>Naruto Uzumaki</h2>

            <div class="later">
                Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the
                jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of
                Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's
                acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many
                hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon
                after,
                the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū,
                literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the main factors in
                winning
                the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage
                (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).

            <div class="later">
                JSasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha
                clan.
                After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge
                them
                by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his rival
                and
                best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his progress, he
                defects
                from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge. His years of seeking
                vengeance
                and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from others,
                leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his brother's
                sacrifice,
                later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto,
                Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its
                inhabitants,
                becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage" (支う影, Sasaukage, literally meaning: Supporting Shadow).

            <div class="later">
                Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu
                Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his
                younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki,
                whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who
                sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be
                more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and
                village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.

                Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of
                the Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly
                looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on
                Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along with the
                Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes
                Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).

            <div class="later">
                Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan. He founded
                Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the intention of beginning
                an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of
                the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into
                hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge
                and plans to Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see
                his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with
                Hashirama before his final death.

                Obito Uchiha (うちはオビト, Uchiha Obito) was a member of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. He was believed to have
                died during the Third Shinobi World War, his only surviving legacy being the Sharingan he gave to his
                teammate, Kakashi Hatake. In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara, but the events of
                the war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an ideal world.
                Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ, Tobi) and Madara Uchiha himself, Obito subtly took control of
                the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance his machinations, eventually going public and starting
                the Fourth Shinobi World War. However, towards the war's conclusion, Obito had a change of heart and, as
                atonement, sacrificed his life to save the same world he sought to replace.
